## Sensors and transmitters

The sensors come in two different "flavors": gray and orange. The grey ones are intended to be used with the pump, the orange versions only work with the CGM-only transmitter. (At least on the Guardian 4 line.)


- MMT-7040x = Guardian 4 sensors
- MMT-7841x = Guardian 4 transmitter
  - where x indicates a variant or revision 
  - A-(B?)-C is the grey
  - Q is the orange

- MMT-7020 = Guardian 3 sensor
- MMT-7911 = Guardian 3 transmitter

The transmitters have a little piece of plastic which prevents the users from mismatching grey/orange sensors in the transmitters. The reason is currently not understood.
